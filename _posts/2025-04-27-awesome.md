- [All-fourths Tuned Guitar](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/tuning-in-4ths-p4-es-041) – Tuning to all fourths offers a highly logical and symmetrical fretboard layout, making chord and scale shapes consistent across all strings. Greatly accelerates fretboard learning, enhances improvisation and music theory understanding.
