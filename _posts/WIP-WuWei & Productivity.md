- **They sense before acting**, developing heightened awareness of system dynamics before intervention
- **They follow energy gradients**, identifying where the system naturally wants to move
- **They establish enabling conditions** rather than dictating outcomes
- **They work with appropriate scale**, matching their intervention to the natural grain of the system
- **They maintain dynamic balance**, neither controlling too tightly nor abandoning guidance entirely
