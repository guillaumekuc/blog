## Limits of classical Harmonic Theory

The standard way harmony is taught in Western pedagogy would gravitate around the Tonal Framework, Roman Numerals, Functional Harmony and Cadences.
In this system, music centers on a key, defined by a home pitch called the tonic and its corresponding major scale. Chords built on each scale degrees define the standard chord set available for progressions. Those chords are labeled using Roman Numerals corresponding to their scale degree position in the key. In the key of C, the I chord would be C, V would be G, ii would be Dm. Functional harmony adds a notion of each chord having a role to play within a key. Some chords are restful (tonic), other set-up tension and lead away (predominant), and yet others are so tense they need to resolve to the tonic (dominant). Building from there, you get cadences, the resulting movements from one chord to others. V to I, the authentic cadence, would get you a strong resolution feel, whereas a IV to I Plagal cadence is often described as a softer resolution.
At its core, it is a closed system which really just juggles 7 diatonic chords, with some considered more stable than others and proposing a sense of natural flow, with some chords wanting to resolve to specific others.

It served anyone from Handel and Vivaldi to Brahms well and we can hear how much structure was added to music thanks in parts to the development of this system. The sense of tonal hierarchy and directional harmonic flow became much more pronounced.
The core criticism I have is: it is much too narrow a system. 
Music evolved beyond the Common practice period. The system finds itself ill-suited to describe even earlier music from the Renaissance and medieval periods that were built on a modal understanding of music. It similarly struggles with romantic, impressionistic, or modernist music. Jazz routinely ventures so far outside the confines of the system, it's barely recognizable. 

Contemporary practices demonstrate that the framework can and is being extended and twisted to fit with devices such as Secondary dominants, Borrowed chords and other Modal mixtures, Pivot chords and many others. However, the deeper you dig, the more working with it feels like constant patching and retro-fitting. We're brute-forcing inappropriate labels onto all sorts of "misbehaved" musical phenomena instead of flat accepting music's emergent properties. 

We collectively are teaching a local grammar, a special case, as if it was a universal language. That system should be thought of as "Common Practice Period harmonic theory" more so than any sort of General Music Theory Framework. 

Strict adherence to this system can often lead to formulaic, unoriginal results. From similar rules you'd expect similar music. On the flip-side, deviating from it is cognitively expensive. It requires tracking ever moving key centers, modulations away from modulations, navigating second and third order branch-offs. A useful harmony system shouldn't treat chromaticisms, modal mixtures, and any kind of tonal ambiguity as exceptions but as primary features. In my experience, the system breaks down when battle-tested against real-time improvising or expressive scoring. 

The state of affairs is calling for a low-level reframe more so than yet another patch.

## Chord Relationships promises

There is a different, simpler, highly practical and more universal organizing framework for harmony that I'd like to share. Credits where it's due: I learned it from talented composer J. Jay Berthume in his video presentation ["Harmonic Relativity"](https://youtu.be/kt5_LPC8epM?si=7OWcpI2TCizj3CU2). I highly recommend checking out this lesson as it can be quite eye-opening. 

At its core, the system is a phenomenological taxonomy: it describes what actually appears in music, rather than prescribing what should happen. It’s also atomic: instead of trying to explain why entire progressions work, it looks at the smallest unit of harmony — the movement from one chord to the next. It treats these movements as lego bricks that can be infinitely recombined and arranged to one's heart's content. This makes the system genre-agnostic and remarkably flexible.
It also describe music in relative terms rather than absolutes, matching the relative nature of the hearing that most of us have. Relative motions is where the emotional colors we pick up on stem from. Overall, this system is particularly well-suited for game or movie composers, and improvisers, who would look as these harmonic gestures as direct pathways towards the emotions they are looking to elicit in their listeners. 

## Notation

The Chord Relationship is the fundamental unit of this system and can be abbreviated as "CR". A CR is the movement from one chord to the next. Its notation is made of three distinct parts. The first block corresponds to the qualify of the departure/root chord. The third and last block describes the quality of the target chord. And in between, the second block contains the interval separating the two chords. 

Chord qualities are picked from a set comprised of the 4 basic triads: major, minor, diminished and augmented. Those particular qualities were choosen as they are still the basis from which most of contemporary music is built off, and to keep the system manageable. They are notated using their letter-based shorthands: "M", "m", "d" and "A". 

The interval in-between is described using roman numerals: "♭V", "II", "♭III", "IV" etc. 

All together, CRs would look like the followings: "M III M", "M ♭II M", "m IV M", "m ♭III m", "m VII M". 

You would quickly notice that there is a finite number of Chord Relationships. 4 potential qualities for the root chord, 4 for the target chord, and 12 potential intervals in between. A quick multiplication reveals that there are 192 CRs to explore. Many of them are not commonly used. In fact, only 33 of them can be extracted from the diatonic scale (3 of which are static CRs: not very note-worthy). As a side note those 30 would be an excellent starting point when venturing into this classification and first putting it to use.

## Emotional colors

To illustrate what makes this system as useful as it is, let's take a look at some colorful CRs.

Here is M bII M. Your associations with this CR may vary, but one wouldn't be blamed for thinking it sounds spicy, spanish or mexicany, warm, tense, fiery, flamenco-ish. 

The practical aspect is that any time you'd want to invoke that particular feeling, you could turn to this CR and use it, be it in improvisation or composition. You would reliably create the sound you are after. All you'd need is a major chord from which to pad-launch into the major chord that's a minor second above.

Next example is M III M. This one to many ears would sound lush or radiant, surreal, majestic, bright. Of course you would have to listen to each CRs and figure out your own associations with each movement. But the point is, once you can recognize and label it, it becomes reusable.

m VII M. Notice how different it feels ? Maybe we'd qualify this one of melancholic, or yearning, tragic, resigned, yet still somewhat dignified or faintly luminous.

Contrast m VII M with m bIII m, a different CR that also brings a feeling of somber tragedy but of a heavier, more poignant kind. I'd say there's even a sense of doom in it. The qualification gets subtle and that's why experiencing these CRs subjectively is critical. However you'd agree that this system emphasizes emotional impact over anything else. There's no layer in between your intent as a composer or improviser and an harmonic solution that does what you're after. 


## Stringing CRs together

So how would one write a chord progression using Chord Relationships ? They'd first pick a set of CRs that match the emotional color they are after, then simply string them together. A CR ends on a major chord, the next has to start from a major chord. This other one ends with minor, then the following has to start with minor. It's no more complicated than that. As long as the CR that were collected match the intent, the overall progression would reliably elicit the feelings you are after, at least from the harmonic standpoint. 

As an example, let's try to create a tender-sounding chord progression. Something with a bit of melancholia and attachment in it. 
We'll first gather a set of Chord Relationships that match our idea of what tender sounds like harmonically. For me, as of right now, I would go for 
m bVI M, M VII m, m bVII M, M VI m.

Here is what get get by combining them.

And then with a simple melody to add some relief to it.

Let's try something else, something contrasting and a lot less comfortable: something with a bit of friction, and wonder and unease. I am hearing m bV M, M bVI M, M bIII m, m VII M. All of which sound interesting to me, rather than flat or expected. What can be done with these ?

Well by mixing them up I came up with this progression.

Add a melody on top and this is a result that was attained very quickly.

Hopefully it doesn't sound cliché, and it is also on target emotionally. I hope it can illustrate how effective this system can be for scoring.
